## Two main components for EEID poster
# 1. How does host richness & functional diversity affect symbiont transmission & richness?
#    - fixed host communities of varying functional diversity & among species transmission
#    - record symbiont transmission rates & richness
# 2. How does habitat heterogeneity affect symbiont transmission & richness?

# Host richness & functional diversity's effects on symbionts
# Need to create host communities that are static that vary in heterogeneity
# and for each of these, explore consequences of varying interspecies transmiss.
# for each run, record mean symbiont transmission & richness

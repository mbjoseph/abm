Static hosts model notes
========================================================

Rather than starting with the full landscape-host-symbiont model, start with just a host-symbiont model, assuming static host populations (fixed abundance& community composition).

Work: 
1) implement static host formulation
2) estimate beta at each time step
3) estimate R0 for each pathogen
4) allow co-infection
5) generate # of symbionts vs. colonization & extinction rates (within & among hosts)

Outline for grazing SEM paper

Introduction
1. Advances in methods to explain species occurrence
  - broad qualitative review of methods, aims
2. Limitations
  - limited to associations with survey data
  - no way to deal with collinearity
  - no good method for dealting with covariate measurement error
  - no ability to evaluate causal pathways, i.e. processes that drive species occurrence
3. Introduce grazing system as a motivation for wanting to explore these paths
  - interested from a basic science standpoint, and an intervention POV
4. Introduce modern SEM framework as solution
  - recent advances allow for a wide variety of models to be specified
  - as we will show, traditional occupancy models fit well within the SEM framework

Materials and methods
1. Data collection
  - sampling scheme
  - sample size
  - covariates
2. Conceptual model
  - conceptual model, justify paths
  - note need to separate veg. effects on occupancy and detection (Burton et al. 2009)
  - effects mediated through changing shoreveg (Jansen and Healy 2002, Healy 1997, Wells 2007)
  - effect of grazing on nutrients (Line 2003, Schmutzer et al. 2008)
  - effect of grazing on shoreline veg (Burton et al. 2009)
  - combine NH4+ and total N b/c affects embryonic survival (Jofre and Karasov 1999, Schmutzer et al. 2008)
3. Model formalization
  - hierarchical Bayesian model
  - separate data model, process model, and parameter model
  - SEM component
  - occupancy component
4. Parameter estimation
  - Bayesian inference
  - vague priors, JAGS, convergence etc.
5. Model performance
  - K-fold cross validation extending Zipkin et al. 2012
  - parameter recovery (simulation study, estimate bias)

Results
1. Description of effects on each species
2. Model performance
  - AUC
  - bias 
  
Discussion
1. Management implications
  - positive effects on salamanders (Pike and Marty 2005)
2. Historical context
3. Statistical context
  - do() operations as a management tool
  - parallels to CJS mark-recapture work
4. Validity of causal inferences

Host-symbiont diversity paper
===========================================

Here's the markdown files etc. to actually make the article. 

### Citation formatting
The current citation format follows Ecology's guidelines, but more formats
(covering most journals) are available on github:

```
git clone git://github.com/citation-style-language/styles.git
```

More info on citations and some other good information can be found on 
the scholarly markdown  
[wiki](https://github.com/scholmd/scholmd/wiki/citations).

You'll need a .bib file that contains the BibTeX citation info for any 
articles that are cited. Most reference management software 
(e.g. [Mendeley](http://www.mendeley.com/), [Zotero](http://www.mendeley.com/), 
[EndNote](http://endnote.com/)) can export a .bib file.
